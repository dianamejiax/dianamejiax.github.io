    <p>Case Study: Facebook & Google Approaches</p>

    <h3>Importance of Effective Product Design</h3>
    <p>Design is a critical ingredient in delivering and creating value. For this reason, it is
essential to dive into the exploration of what is successful design. Good and effective
design can help generate positive responses and reactions by users, it can propose
solutions and solve real needs, it can strengthen the identity of a brand, it can engage
an audience to a greater level—the list is endless!</p>

    <p>
      But something to bare in mind is to think what exactly makes product design effective.
There are many little and big aspects that make a big difference when it comes to the
quality and effectiveness of a product design. For instance, it could be the story behind
the product and the way that the product is communicated to its users, it could be the
unexpected microinteractions and patterns incorporated into a design itself, it could be
the way it enhances daily activities in the life of a user. These are all factors to consider
in the process of crafting a product.
    </p>
    <h3>Google</h3>
    <p>To dig deeper into the topic of what is effective product design. It is inspiring to look
and analyze at what existing companies are doing in terms of product development and
their strategies into delivering a product. For the purpose of this exploration, there will
be a focus on Google and Facebook and taking a glance at some of the principles
guiding design decisions in each respective company.</p>

<p>Peeking into Google, it is addressed that there are many layers that go into crafting an
effective product design. At Google, design takes place in three main stages including:
early conceptual work, mid-stage mockup and prototype creation, and late-stage build.
At google, an effective design comprehensively addresses the problem, the solution in
expression of user interface (UI), and implementation of that solution (Google, 2016). In
there guide there are a series of questions to think of at each given phase of a product.
For example, in the mid-stage there is heavy consideration of User Experience (UX) and
evaluation of prototypes and mockup builds.These are some questions for individuals
to think to assure effectivity:<br>
1. Is your design actually addressing the problem all stakeholders have agreed
upon?<br>
2. Is the architecture and organization of the app or feature intuitive?<br>
3. Are you using predictable UI patterns that are recognizable and appropriate for
the platform?</p>

<p>Through each stage, it is also important to keep in mind one essential question which is
if design propositions are targeting the overall problem and if it is meeting defined
goals. A compelling package should be on-brand, it should accommodate to users, and
it should facilitate a compelling experience.</p>

    <h3>Facebook</h3>
    <p>Facebook has proven itself to be a leader at engaging and facilitating user experiences
through its products and tools. There are a couple of principles that are enforced in
order to help craft effective design within this tech company. Margaret Gould Stewart,
Vice-President of Product Design in Facebook highlights that “Good design should solve
a real problem. It should be easy to use. It should be well crafted” (Stewart, 2015).</p>
    <p>For Facebook, the four guiding principles for designing effective products include:
helping people learn and grow, balancing efficiency and effectiveness, bringing clarity to
complexity, being accurate and predictable. Overall, there is that idea that when
designing for people, designers have a tremendously huge role and responsibility to
help people do better. This essentially means to design systems and user experiences
that will make individuals succeed.</p>
    <p>Like for any project creating a solid product design is a challenge. There are many
iterations, modifications, and versions throughout the course of a product design cycle.
But it is through these trials and errors, that product designers are able to identify areas
of improvement.</p>

<h3>Storytelling</h3>

<p>Above all, background production and the cycle of a product is critical. Design language
is important, but functionality, effectiveness, and clarity is equally important. A good
technique to adapt to avoid potential confusion is to “create a series of narrative
use-cases for your product that illustrates every step in the user’s journey” (Kowitz).
Creating a story-centered design becomes more relatable and engaging to potential
users. This is because designers are encouraged to think beyond the surface visuals
and think of how users may interact with a product. Overall, putting into focus what the
user may go through throughout the whole process and placing designers to join that
journey as well.</p>
